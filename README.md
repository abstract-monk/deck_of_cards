# Deck of Cards Code Puzzle

This code represents a deck of cards.

It uses a class called "Card" to represent an instance of a single card,
and a class called "Deck" to represent a collection of 52 unique playing
cards that can be arranged by Suit and Rank.

You can shuffle the Deck, randomly changing the order of the collection.

You can draw cards one at a time until the Deck is empty.

The Suits are: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades
The Ranks are: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

Also included TestRunner class that runs some pretty basic test methods.

Can be improved by writing a real Test class using JUnit testing.
